# Define a procedure, sum_evens, that takes
# as an argument a list of numbers, and returns
# the sum of all the even integers from the list
#
# For example,
# sum_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 6
# sum_evens([7, 21, -9]) = 0
# sum_evens([0.5, 4]) = 4
# Define a procedure, how_long_til_lunch, that takes
# three inputs: an integer representing the current hour,
# an integer representing the current minutes, and
# a string that is either 'am' or 'pm'.
#
# The output should be how long you have to wait from the
# given time until 11:45 am, in minutes (an integer).
#
# If you're unsure how the 12-hour clock works, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock
#
# For example, how_long_til_lunch(5, 45, 'pm') = 1080
# Define a procedure, string_split, that takes
# as an argument a list of strings, and returns
# a list of two elements: the first element is the
# concatenation of all the strings in the first half
# of the list, and the second element is the
# concatenation of all the strings in the second half
# of the list. If the input list is odd length, add the
# middle string to the first element.
#
# For example,
# string_split(['Hello', ' world!',
# 'Goodnight', ' moon!']) =
# ['Hello world!', 'Goodnight moon!']
#
# string_split(['one', 'two', 'three']) =
# ['onetwo', 'three']
#
# string_split([]) = ['', '']
