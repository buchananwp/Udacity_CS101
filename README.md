# Udacity_CS101
CS101: Intro to Computer Science
------
I am nearing completion of this introductory computer programming course taught in Python, by [Prof. David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101). Several key search engine components (including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm) are built through the course. Other topics include procedural programming (methods, parameters, return, values), basic control structures (sequence, if/else, for loop, while loop), data structures (dictionaries, hashing, lists, strings), and recursion.

##### Selected problems:
[Only A Little Lucky (Search Engine)](https://github.com/buchananwp/Udacity_CS101/blob/master/L24Q3_OnlyALittleLucky.py)
