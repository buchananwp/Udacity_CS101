------
I am nearing completion of this introductory computer programming course taught in Python, by [Prof. David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101
). Several key search engine components (including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm) are built through the course.

##### Selected problems:
