CS101: Intro to Computer Science
------
I completed this introductory computer programming course taught in Python, by [Prof. David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101). Several key search engine components (including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm) are built through the course. Other topics include procedural programming (methods, parameters, return, values), basic control structures (sequence, if/else, for loop, while loop), data structures (dictionaries, hashing, lists, strings), and recursion.

This includes the theory quizzes, problem sets and optional problem sets.
